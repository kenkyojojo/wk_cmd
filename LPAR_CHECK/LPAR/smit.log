License agreement for:
	bos.rte

International Program License Agreement

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE 
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF 
ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT 
THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO 
THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM 
YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED 
THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.

"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its 
subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific 
to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ 
. The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of 
a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial 
copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) 
audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) 
related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and 
documentation.

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a 
Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the 
number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for 
warranty, future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional 
opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the 
original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or 
its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies 
the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal 
entity.

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms 
(if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete 
agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any 
prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of 
the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this 
Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the 
terms of the latter agreement prevail.

1. Entitlement

License

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and 
licensed, not sold.

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully 
acquire it.

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) 
make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all 
copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial 
copy, of the Program.

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade 
You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another 
party.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or 
remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its 
PoE.

Money-back Guarantee

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the 
original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if 
within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the 
party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact 
the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.

Program Transfer

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to 
another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When 
You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, 
including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.

2. Charges

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in 
the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, 
except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You 
acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified 
or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal 
property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

3. Limited Warranty

IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating 
environment it will conform to its specifications. The warranty applies only to 
the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or 
error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct all Program 
defects. You are responsible for the results obtained from the use of the 
Program. 

IBM provides You with access to IBM databases containing information on known 
Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses at no 
additional charge. Consult the IBM Software Support Guide for further 
information at http://www.ibm.com/software/support . IBM will maintain this 
information for at least one year after the original licensee acquires the 
Program ("Warranty Period").

If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and 
the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, 
You may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its 
reseller) from whom You acquired it and receive a refund in the amount You 
paid. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You 
acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund. 

THESE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES 
OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, 
SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES 
APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS 
ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

THESE WARRANTIES GIVE YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER 
RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

4. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the 
Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and 
suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively 
responsible.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES; OR

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

5. General

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force 
and effect.

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations.

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including 
names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such 
information will be processed and used in connection with our business 
relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and 
assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for 
promotions, and for market research).

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations 
due to causes beyond its control.

7. This Agreement will not create any right or cause of action for any third 
party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You 
except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily 
injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for 
which IBM is legally liable.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration

Governing Law

Both You and IBM consent to the application of the laws of the country in which 
You acquired the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Your 
and IBM's rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any 
manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of 
law principles.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
does not apply.
	
Jurisdiction

All of our rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the 
country in which You acquired the Program license.

supplied only in the English language.

Program-unique Terms

1.0 SPECIFIED OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

The following Specified Operating Environment may be changed by future product 
or program announcements. Please consult Your IBM Sales Representative or its 
authorized reseller from whom You acquired the Program for latest changes.

1.1 Machine Requirements

Selected IBM PowerPC(R) 970 systems, POWER4(TM) systems, POWER5(TM) systems or 
POWER6(TM) systems that implement the POWER Architecture(TM) Platform 
Requirements (PAPR).

1.2 Programming Requirements

Systems operating on AIX(R) Version 6.1 are supported only when used within the 
system operating environments described in the appropriate hardware 
announcements and when used within the specified operating environment. When 
systems operating on AIX Version 6.1 are used with other software or software 
in later announcements, other limitations may be included.

1.2.1 AIX Software Requirements:

See the program announcements for the minimum physical memory and disk space 
requirements for AIX Version 6.1.

IBM Tivoli(R) Directory Server Version 6.1 requires a minimum of 256 MB RAM for 
the Client and a minimum of 512 MB of RAM (1 GB or more is strongly 
recommended) for the Server. IBM Tivoli Directory Server (including the Client 
and the Server) requires about 160 MB of disk space.

IBM Tivoli Directory Server includes the DB2 Universal Database(TM) for AIX 
Version 8.1 Restricted Enterprise Server Edition. No previous versions of DB2 
are supported. If You already have DB2 installed, You need approximately 45 MB 
of disk space to create the empty database and start the server. DB2 requires 
about 300-500 MB of disk space. Disk space required for data storage is 
dependent upon the number and size of database entries.

You must be running on 64-bit hardware.

You must be running a 64-bit kernel.

1.2.2 Program Specifications

AIX Version 6.1 does not support 32-bit kernels or 32-bit kernel extensions. 
Please see program announcements for other program offerings.

2.0 AIX USAGE LIMITATIONS

2.1 AUTHORIZED USE

You are only authorized to use the Programs to the same extent as provided in 
the Proof(s) of Entitlement for the AIX operating system, and on additional 
temporary processors for which You have rightfully acquired, from IBM or its 
authorized reseller, the right to use on a temporary basis.

Your license entitlement to the Programs is for a specified number of 
processors, within a specified processor group. A hardware upgrade to a greater 
number of processors or to a different processor group will require You to 
update Your entitlement to use the Program. The required entitlement for a 
Program shall be based upon the specific hardware configuration, including the 
number of processors within a specified processor group on which You may use 
the Programs.

The number of processors within a specified processor group used by a Program 
in a machine is the smaller value of either of the following methods:

- The total number of activated processors in the machine, or

- The sum of (a) and (b) as follows (any remaining fraction of a processor must 
be rounded up to a full processor in the final aggregation):

(a) When a Program is run in partitions with dedicated processors, the sum of 
the processing units of those partitions, and

(b) When a Program is run in partitions that are members of a shared processing 
pool, the smaller of:

(i) the number of processors assigned to the pool, or

(ii) the sum of the virtual processors of each uncapped partition plus the 
processing units in each capped partition running a Program

2.2 Moving AIX with Live Partition Mobility

To perform a Live Partition Mobility (LPAR) operation, You must be entitled to 
use the Programs on both the source and destination systems. The number of 
Program processor cores transferred by LPAR must equal the number of processor 
core entitlements on the destination system.

2.3 Audit

IBM or its authorized reseller may audit Your compliance with these terms upon 
reasonable advance notice to You.

3.0 TRANSFER OF PROGRAM RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

You may not transfer the Program to another party. You may move the Program, 
subject to Your Entitlement, to another machine within Your Enterprise. An 
Enterprise is any legal entity (including, without limitation, an individual, a 
partnership or a corporation) and its Subsidiaries. A Subsidiary is any legal 
entity, during the time that more than 50 percent of its voting stock, or if no 
voting stock, decision-making power, is owned or controlled, directly or 
indirectly, by the Enterprise.

If the Programs are moved to another machine within Your Enterprise in 
accordance with Section 2.1 AUTHORIZED USE, use of the Programs shall remain 
governed by this Agreement. In the event You wish to use the Programs on a 
different machine within Your Enterprise with either i) a greater number of 
processors or ii) any number of processors within a different processor group 
than the original machine, then You must obtain proper entitlement from IBM or 
its authorized reseller and must update Your entitlement to any software 
maintenance and support for such Programs. The transfer of the Programs to 
another machine within Your enterprise terminates Your authorization to use the 
Program on the machine from which the Programs have been transferred.

4.0 SUB-CAPACITY PRICING, USAGE AND BILLING ON DISTRIBUTED PLATFORMS

This Program is eligible for sub-capacity pricing, usage and billing. The 
following terms apply to its use:

1) You must acquire authorization from IBM or its authorized reseller for use 
of the Program on each processor for each partitioned environment.

2) IBM and its authorized resellers do not provide credits or refunds for 
charges already due or paid if a Program's use falls below the authorized 
entitlement.

3) If in the future IBM or its authorized reseller makes a license management 
program (a program that records and reports Program use information to IBM or 
its authorized reseller) available to You for measuring Program use, You agree 
to appropriately install, configure and execute such license management program 
beginning no later than 180 days from the date it is made available to You by 
IBM or its authorized reseller and continuing for the period that You use the 
Program.

4) If IBM or its authorized reseller makes such license management program 
available to You with the machine on which You are authorized to execute the 
Program, You agree to appropriately install, configure and execute such license 
management program beginning no later than 180 days from the date on which You 
begin using the Program on such authorized machine and continuing for the 
period that You use the Program.

5) If IBM or its authorized reseller provides the license management program to 
You, You agree to transmit reporting requirements and an email address, or if 
requested by You, an alternative contact method to IBM or its authorized 
reseller for the purpose of monitoring Your usage of the Program and for 
billing You for usage of the Program which exceeds Your authorized entitlement. 
You agree that IBM or its authorized reseller may store and use Your 
Information internally for any purpose. IBM or its authorized reseller may also 
share Your Information with third parties such as IBM Business Partners, 
subcontractors and consultants under contract to IBM or its authorized reseller 
for purposes of usage monitoring, problem determination, assisting You with 
performance and capacity planning, assisting IBM or its authorized resellers to 
enhance products and services and notifying You of Your system status and 
solutions available to You.

6) You agree that upon reasonable written notice IBM or its authorized reseller 
has the right to verify Your compliance on Your premises during normal business 
hours. IBM or its authorized reseller may use an independent auditor for this 
purpose with Your prior approval which You agree not to unreasonably withhold 
or delay.

5.0 BUILT-IN-CAPACITY

A machine may include computing resources or capabilities that are to remain 
inactive, or whose use is restricted, until the right to access and use the 
resources or capabilities is purchased (Built-in-Capacity). Examples of such 
computing resources and capabilities include but are not limited to processors, 
memory, storage, processing capacity identified as interactive processing 
capacity, and/or workload specific resources or capabilities (such as 
limitations on the use for a specific operating system, programming language or 
application). You are licensed to use the Program only to the extent of 
authorizations You have acquired for access to and use of Built-in-Capacity. 
You agree that if Your use of Built-in-Capacity exceeds the authorizations You 
have acquired, You will be liable to IBM or its authorized reseller for the 
full price of permanent, unrestricted use of the Built-in-Capacity at IBM's 
current list price.

5.1 Built-in Capacity Restrictions

Built-in-Capacity is protected by certain technological measures. As a 
condition for Your license to the Program under the Agreement, You may not 
circumvent such technological measures, or use a third party or third party 
product to do so, or otherwise access or use unauthorized Built-in-Capacity. In 
the event IBM determines that changes are necessary to the technological 
measures designed to limit access to, or use of, Built-in-Capacity to that 
which has been authorized, IBM or its authorized reseller may provide You with 
changes to such technological measures. As a condition for Your license to the 
Program hereunder, You agree, at IBM's option or its authorized reseller's 
option, to apply or allow IBM or its authorized reseller to apply such changes.

6.0 IBM SUPPLIED PROGRAM CODE UPDATES (PCUs)

Application of PCUs supplied to You by IBM or its authorized reseller may 
disable or render ineffective programs that circumvent control technology 
designed to protect Built-in Capacity, including measures that may impact 
availability of data or performance of Your machine. As a condition of Your 
license to use the Program under this Agreement, You agree, at IBM's option, to 
apply or allow IBM to apply such PCUs.

7.0 UPGRADE

If the Program is an upgrade, You are authorized to use the Program only if You 
are an authorized user of a previous version or release of the Program that 
qualifies You for the upgrade (the "Qualifying Product"), and provided You (i) 
either destroy the Qualifying Product or install the new Program on the same 
machine as the Qualifying Product and (ii) do not transfer the Qualifying 
Product to any other person or use it on any other machine.

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully 
acquire it.

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) 
make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all 
copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial 
copy, of the Program.

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade 
You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another 
party.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or 
remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its 
PoE.

Money-back Guarantee

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the 
original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if 
within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the 
party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact 
the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.

Program Transfer

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to 
another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When 
You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, 
including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.

2. Charges

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in 
the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, 
except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You 
acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified 
or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal 
property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

3. No Warranty

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL 
SUPPORT, IF ANY.

The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers.

Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs may provide their 
own warranties.

IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM specifies otherwise.

4. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the 
Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and 
suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively 
responsible.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES; OR

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

5. General

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force 
and effect.

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations.

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including 
names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such 
information will be processed and used in connection with our business 
relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and 
assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for 
promotions, and for market research).

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations 
due to causes beyond its control.

7. This Agreement will not create any right or cause of action for any third 
party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You 
except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily 
injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for 
which IBM is legally liable.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO 
WARRANTY OR CONDITION EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM.

Limitation of Liability (Section 4): The following replaces the terms of this 
section in its entirety: 

For the purposes of this section, a "Default" means any act, statement, 
omission, or negligence on the part of IBM in connection with, or in relation 
to, the subject matter of an Agreement in respect of which IBM is legally 
liable to You, whether in contract or tort. A number of Defaults which together 
result in, or contribute to, substantially the same loss or damage will be 
treated as one Default.

Circumstances may arise where, because of a Default, You are entitled to 
recover damages from IBM. This section sets out the extent of IBM's liability 
and Your sole remedy.

1. IBM will accept unlimited liability for:

a. death or personal injury caused by the negligence of IBM; 

b. any breach of its obligations implied by Section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 
1979 or Section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, or any 
statutory modification or re-enactment of either such Section; and

c. subject always to the Items for Which IBM is Not Liable below, for physical 
damage to Your tangible property resulting from the negligence of IBM.

2. IBM's entire liability for actual damages for any one Default will not in 
any event, except as provided in item 1 above, exceed the greater of 1) Pounds 
Sterling 75,000, or 2) 125 percent of the amount You paid for the Program 
directly relating to the Default. These limits also apply to IBM's suppliers 
and Program developers. They state the maximum for which IBM and such suppliers 
and Program developers are collectively responsible.

Items for Which IBM is Not Liable

Save with respect to any liability referred to in item 1 above, under no 
circumstances is IBM or any of its suppliers or Program developers liable for 
any of the following, even if IBM or they were informed of the possibility of 
such losses:

1. loss of, or damage to, data;

2. special, indirect, or consequential loss; or

3. loss of profits, business, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings.

License Agreement for Machine Code 
Z125-5468-01 6/2002 
You accept the terms of this IBM License Agreement for Machine Code 
("Agreement") by your initial use of a Machine that contains Machine Code. 
If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you may return Machine Code 
and the Machine in the same condition in which they were delivered to you to 
the 
party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom you acquired the Machine for a 
refund of the amount you paid if 1) you are the original user and 2) you do so 
within 15 days of the Machine's delivery to you and prior to completion of the 
first initialization (for example, the first initial program load or the first 
initial microcode load) of the Machine. 
The term "Machine Code" means microcode, basic input/output system code (called 
"BIOS"), utility programs, device drivers, and diagnostics delivered with an 
IBM 
Machine. Machine Code does not include programs and code provided under 
separate 
license agreements, including but not limited to open source license 
agreements. 
Acceptance of these license terms authorizes you to use Machine Code with the 
specific product for which it is provided. 
The term "Machine" means an IBM machine, its features, conversions, upgrades, 
elements or accessories, or any combination of them. 
A Machine may include computing resources or capabilities that are to remain 
inactive, or whose use is restricted, until the right to access and use the 
resources or capabilities is acquired from IBM (called "Built-in-Capacity"). 
Examples of such computing resources and capabilities include but are not 
limited to processors, memory, storage, processing capacity identified as 
interactive processing capacity, and workload specific resources or 
capabilities 
(such as a specific operating system, programming language or application to 
which use of the Machine is limited). 
International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries 
(collectively "IBM") owns copyrights in Machine Code or has the right to 
license 
Machine Code. IBM or a third party owns all copies of Machine Code, including 
all copies made from them. IBM licenses Machine Code to only one rightful 
possessor at a time. 
If you are the rightful possessor of a Machine, IBM grants you a nonexclusive 
license to use Machine Code on, or in conjunction with, only the Machine for 
which IBM provided it, and only to the extent of IBM authorizations you have 
acquired for access to and use of Built-in-Capacity. If your use of 
Built-in-Capacity exceeds the IBM authorizations you have acquired for the 
Machine, you agree to pay IBM for the full price of permanent, unrestricted use 
of the Built-in-Capacity at IBM's then current price. You are not authorized to 
use such Built-in-Capacity until such payment is made. 
Under each license, IBM authorizes you to do only the following: 
  execute Machine Code to enable the Machine to function according to its 
  Official Published Specifications (called "Specifications") and to use only 
  the Built-in-Capacity for which you are authorized and for which payment is 
  received by IBM; 
  make a reasonable number of copies of Machine Code to be used solely for 
  backup or archival purposes, provided you reproduce the copyright notice and 
  any other legend of ownership on any such copies. You may use the copies only 
  to replace the original, when necessary; and 
  execute and display Machine Code as necessary to maintain the Machine. 
You agree to acquire any replacement for, or additional copy of, Machine Code 
directly from IBM in accordance with IBM's standard policies and practices. You 
also agree to use that Machine Code under these terms. 
You may transfer possession of Machine Code and its media to another party only 
with the transfer of the Machine on which Machine Code is authorized. If you do 
so, you must 1) destroy all your copies of Machine Code that were not provided 
by IBM, 2) either give the other party all your IBM-provided copies of Machine 
Code or destroy them, and 3) give the other party a copy of these terms and 
provide all user documentation to that party. IBM licenses the other party when 
it accepts these terms. These terms apply to all Machine Code you acquire from 
any source. 
Your license for Machine Code terminates when you no longer rightfully possess 
the Machine. 
No other rights under this license are granted. 
You agree to use Machine Code only as authorized above. You may not do, for 
example, any of the following: 
  otherwise copy, display, transfer, adapt, modify, or distribute 
  (electronically or otherwise) Machine Code, except as IBM may authorize in a 
  Machine's user documentation or in writing to you; 
  reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate Machine Code, 
unless 
  expressly permitted by applicable law without the possibility of contractual 
  waiver; 
  sublicense or assign the license for Machine Code; or 
  lease Machine Code or any copy of it. 
  Built-in-Capacity is protected by certain technological measures in Machine 
  Code. As a condition of your license to use Machine Code under this 
Agreement, 
  you may not circumvent such technological measures, or use a third party or 
  third party product to do so, or otherwise access or use unauthorized 
  Built-in-Capacity. In the event IBM determines that changes are necessary to 
  the technological measures designed to limit access to, or use of, 
  Built-in-Capacity to that which has been authorized, IBM may provide you with 
  changes to such technological measures. As a condition of your license to use 
  Machine Code under this Agreement, you agree, at IBM's option, to apply or 
  allow IBM to apply such changes. 
  The terms of IBM's Statement of Limited Warranty (Z125-4753), which is 
  incorporated into this Agreement by reference, apply to Machine Code. Please 
  refer to that warranty for any questions or claims regarding performance or 
  liability for Machine Code. 
  If there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those of any 
  other agreement for Machine Code, the terms of this Agreement prevail to the 
  extent of the conflict, unless otherwise expressly provided in the other 
  agreement.

it accepts these terms. These terms apply to all Machine Code you acquire from 
any source. 
Your license for Machine Code terminates when you no longer rightfully possess 
the Machine. 
No other rights under this license are granted. 
You agree to use Machine Code only as authorized above. You may not do, for

International Program License Agreement


Part 1 - General Terms


PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM. IBM WILL LICENSE 
THE PROGRAM TO YOU ONLY IF YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY 
USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF 
THIS AGREEMENT, PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED PROGRAM TO THE PARTY (EITHER IBM OR 
ITS RESELLER) FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO RECEIVE A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU 
PAID.

The Program is owned by International Business Machines Corporation or one of 
its subsidiaries (IBM) or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not 
sold.

The term "Program" means the original program and all whole or partial copies 
of it. A Program consists of machine-readable instructions, its components, 
data, audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 
related licensed materials.

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms, 
and "License Information" and is the complete agreement regarding the use of 
this Program, and replaces any prior oral or written communications between you 
and IBM. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1.


1. License

Use of the Program

IBM grants you a nonexclusive license to use the Program.

You may 1) use the Program to the extent of authorizations you have acquired 
and 2) make and install copies to support the level of use authorized, 
providing you reproduce the copyright notice and any other legends of ownership 
on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.

If you acquire this Program as a program upgrade, your authorization to use the 
Program from which you upgraded is terminated.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program does so only in compliance 
with the terms of this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

Transfer of Rights and Obligations

You may transfer all your license rights and obligations under a Proof of 
Entitlement for the Program to another party by transferring the Proof of 
Entitlement and a copy of this Agreement and all documentation. The transfer of 
your license rights and obligations terminates your authorization to use the 
Program under the Proof of Entitlement.


2. Proof of Entitlement

The Proof of Entitlement for this Program is evidence of your authorization to 
use this Program and of your eligibility for warranty services, future upgrade 
program prices (if announced), and potential special or promotional 
opportunities.


3. Charges and Taxes

IBM defines use for the Program for charging purposes and specifies it in the 
Proof of Entitlement. Charges are based on extent of use authorized. If you 
wish to increase the extent of use, notify IBM or its reseller and pay any 
applicable charges. IBM does not give refunds or credits for charges already 
due or paid.

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program supplied by IBM under this Agreement, then 
you agree to pay that amount as IBM specifies or supply exemption 
documentation.


4. Limited Warranty

IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating 
environment it will conform to its specifications. IBM does not warrant 
uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that we will correct 
all Program defects. You are responsible for the results obtained from the use 
of the Program. The warranty period for the Program expires when its Program 
services are no longer available. The License Information specifies the 
duration of Program services.

During the warranty period warranty service is provided without charge for the 
unmodified portion of the Program through defect-related Program services. 
Program services are available for at least one year following the Program's 
general availability. Therefore, the duration of warranty service depends on 
when you obtain your license. If the Program does not function as warranted 
during the first year after you obtain your license and IBM is unable to 
resolve the problem by providing a correction, restriction, or bypass, you may 
return the Program to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom you 
acquired it and receive a refund in the amount you paid for it. To be eligible, 
you must have acquired the Program while Program services (regardless of the 
remaining duration) were available for it.

THESE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES 
OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.

These warranties give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other 
rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not 
allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above exclusion 
or limitation may not apply to you. In that event such warranties are limited 
in duration to the warranty period. No warranties apply after that period.


5. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, you are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which you may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the greater of U.S. 
$100,000 (or equivalent in your local currency) or the charges for the Program 
that is the subject of the claim.

IBM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR 
ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS), EVEN IF 
IBM, OR ITS RESELLER, HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

IBM will not be liable for 1) loss of, or damage to, your records or data or 2) 
any damages claimed by you based on any third party claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to any developer of a Program 
supplied to IBM. It is the maximum for which IBM and its suppliers are 
collectively responsible.


6. General

Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot 
be waived or limited by contract.

IBM may terminate your license if you fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, your authorization to use the Program is also 
terminated.

You agree to comply with applicable export laws and regulations.

Neither you nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

Neither you nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due 
to causes beyond its control.

The laws of the country in which you acquire the Program govern this Agreement, 
except 1) in Australia, the laws of the State or Territory in which the 
transaction is performed govern this Agreement; 2) in Albania, Armenia, 
Belarus, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, 
Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), 
Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Ukraine, and 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the laws of Austria govern this Agreement; 3) 
in the United Kingdom, all disputes relating to this Agreement will be governed 
by English Law and will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
English courts; 4) in Canada, the laws in the Province of Ontario govern this 
Agreement; and 5) in the United States and Puerto Rico, and People's Republic 
of China, the laws of the State of New York govern this Agreement.

International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE 
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF 
ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT 
THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO 
THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM 
YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED 
THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.

"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its 
subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific 
to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ 
. The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of 
a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial 
copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) 
audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) 
related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and 
documentation.

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a 
Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the 
number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for 
 future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional 
opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the 
original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or 
its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies 
the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal 
entity.

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms 
(if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete 
agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any 
prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of 
the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this 
Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the 
terms of the latter agreement prevail.

1. Entitlement

License

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and 
licensed, not sold.

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully 
acquire it.

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) 
make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all 
copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial 
copy, of the Program.

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade 
You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another 
party.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or 
remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its 
PoE.

Money-back Guarantee

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the 
original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if 
within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the 
party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact 
the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.

Program Transfer

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to 
another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When 
You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, 
including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.

2. Charges

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in 
the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, 
except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You 
acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified 
or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal 
property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

3. No Warranty

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL 
SUPPORT, IF ANY.

The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers.

Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs may provide their 
own warranties.

IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM specifies otherwise.

4. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the 
Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and 
suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively 
responsible.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES; OR

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

5. General

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force 
and effect.

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations.

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including 
names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such 
information will be processed and used in connection with our business 
relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and 
assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for 
promotions, and for market research).

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations 
due to causes beyond its control.

7. This Agreement will not create any right or cause of action for any third 
party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You 
except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily 
injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for 
which IBM is legally liable.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration

Governing Law

Both You and IBM consent to the application of the laws of the country in which 
You acquired the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Your 
and IBM's rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any 
manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of

uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct 
all Program defects. You are responsible for the results obtained from the use 
of the Program.

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the warranty period and 
the problem cannot be resolved with information available. You may return the 
Program to the party from whom You acquired it and receive a refund in the 
amount You paid. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from 
whom You acquired it to obtain the refund.

This is our sole obligation to You, except as otherwise required by applicable

International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE 
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF 
ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT 
THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO 
THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM 
YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED 
THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.

"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its 
subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific 
to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ 
. The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of 
a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial 
copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) 
audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) 
related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and 
documentation.

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a 
Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the 
number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for 
 future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional 
opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the 
original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or 
its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies 
the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal 
entity.

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms 
(if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete 
agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any 
prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of 
the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this 
Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the 
terms of the latter agreement prevail.

1. Entitlement

License

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and 
licensed, not sold.

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully 
acquire it.

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) 
make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all 
copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial 
copy, of the Program.

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade 
You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another 
party.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or 
remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its 
PoE.

Money-back Guarantee

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the 
original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if 
within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the 
party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact 
the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.

Program Transfer

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to 
another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When 
You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, 
including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.

2. Charges

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in 
the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, 
except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You 
acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified 
or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal 
property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

3. No Warranty

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL 
SUPPORT, IF ANY.

The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers.

Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs may provide their 
own warranties.

IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM specifies otherwise.

4. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the 
Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and 
suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively 
responsible.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES; OR

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

5. General

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force 
and effect.

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations.

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including 
names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such 
information will be processed and used in connection with our business 
relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and 
assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for 
promotions, and for market research).

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations 
due to causes beyond its control.

7. This Agreement will not create any right or cause of action for any third 
party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You 
except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily 
injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for 
which IBM is legally liable.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration

Governing Law

Both You and IBM consent to the application of the laws of the country in which 
You acquired the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Your 
and IBM's rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any 
manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the warranty period and 
the problem cannot be resolved with information available. You may return the 
Program to the party from whom You acquired it and receive a refund in the

International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE 
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF 
ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT 
THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO 
THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM 
YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED 
THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.

"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its 
subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific 
to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ 
. The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of 
a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial 
copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) 
audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) 
related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and 
documentation.

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a 
Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the 
number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for 
 future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional 
opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the 
original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or 
its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies 
the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal 
entity.

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms 
(if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete 
agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any 
prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of 
the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this 
Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the 
terms of the latter agreement prevail.

1. Entitlement

License

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and 
licensed, not sold.

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully 
acquire it.

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) 
make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all 
copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial 
copy, of the Program.

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade 
You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another 
party.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or 
remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its 
PoE.

Money-back Guarantee

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the 
original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if 
within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the 
party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact 
the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.

Program Transfer

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to 
another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When 
You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, 
including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.

2. Charges

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in 
the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, 
except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You 
acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified 
or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal 
property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

3. No Warranty

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL 
SUPPORT, IF ANY.

The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers.

Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs may provide their 
own warranties.

IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM specifies otherwise.

4. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the 
Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and 
suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively 
responsible.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES; OR

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

5. General

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force 
and effect.

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations.

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including 
names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such 
information will be processed and used in connection with our business 
relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and 
assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for 
promotions, and for market research).

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations 
due to causes beyond its control.

7. This Agreement will not create any right or cause of action for any third 
party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You 
except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily 
injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for 
which IBM is legally liable.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration

Governing Law

Both You and IBM consent to the application of the laws of the country in which 
You acquired the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Your

expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, 
otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of 
the Program's components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related 
licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or 
lease the Program; and

f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this 
Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in 
the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a 
Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this 
Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this 
Item "f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM 
Program ("Principal Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the 
Principal Program's LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program 
without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom 
Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)

This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.

3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches

3.1.1 Trade-ups

If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program's 
license is promptly terminated.

3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches

When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts 
any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or 
patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are 
provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. 
If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly 
discontinue use of the replaced Program.

3.2 Fixed Term Licenses

If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee's license is terminated 
at the end of the fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.

3.3 Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms 
of this Agreement.

If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to 
promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the 
Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond 
termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to 
both parties' respective successors and assignees.

4. Charges

Charges are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the PoE. 
IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as 
specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or 
an authorized IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.

5. Taxes

If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding 
those based on IBM's net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as 
specified in an invoice, or supply exemption documentation. Licensee is 
responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that 
Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee 
for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program 
outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, 
then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount 
imposed.

6. Money-back Guarantee

If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original 
Licensee, Licensee may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount 
Licensee paid for the Program, provided that Licensee returns the Program and 
PoE to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days of the date the 
PoE was issued to Licensee. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject 
to renewal, then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program and its PoE 
are returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee 
downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee 
obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

7. Program Transfer

Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee's license rights and 
obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this 
Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, 
Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party. Licensee 
may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program's Authorized 
Use. When Licensee transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard 
copy of this Agreement, including the LI and PoE. Immediately after the 
transfer, Licensee's license terminates.

8. Warranty and Exclusions

8.1 Limited Warranty

IBM warrants that the Program, when used in its specified operating 
environment, will conform to its specifications. The Program's specifications, 
and specified operating environment information, can be found in documentation 
accompanying the Program (such as a read-me file) or other information 
published by IBM (such as an announcement letter). Licensee agrees that such 
documentation and other Program content may be supplied only in the English 
language, unless otherwise required by local law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation.

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does 
not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program, or that IBM 
will correct all Program defects. Licensee is responsible for the results 
obtained from the use of the Program.

During the Warranty Period, IBM provides Licensee with access to IBM databases 
containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, 
restrictions, and bypasses at no additional charge. Consult the IBM Software 
Support Handbook for further information at www.ibm.com/software/support.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and 
the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, 
Licensee may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its 
reseller) from whom Licensee obtained it and receive a refund of the amount 
Licensee paid. After returning the Program, Licensee's license terminates. If 
Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom 
Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

8.2 Exclusions

THESE WARRANTIES ARE LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF 
NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE 
WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, 
SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

THESE WARRANTIES GIVE LICENSEE SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE 
OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 8 (WARRANTY AND EXCLUSIONS) ARE PROVIDED SOLELY 
BY IBM. THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SUBSECTION 8.2 (EXCLUSIONS), HOWEVER, ALSO 
APPLY TO IBM'S SUPPLIERS OF THIRD PARTY CODE. THOSE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE SUCH CODE 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT NULLIFY 
IBM'S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9. Licensee Data and Databases

To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM 
may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 
2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not 
obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate 
written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of 
technical support, which is beyond IBM's warranty obligations in this 
Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to 
improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related 
support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and 
subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which 
Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.

Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database 
Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of 
procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and 
transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) 
backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send 
or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in 
data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other 
amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided 
to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those 
arising out of any third party claims.

10. Limitation of Liability

The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) 
apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the 
possibility of contractual waiver.

10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the 
basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including 
fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort 
claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or 
related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not 
exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and 
damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual 
direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term 
charges, up to twelve months' charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is 
the subject of the claim.

This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is 
the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are 
collectively responsible.

10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:

a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR

c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

11. Compliance Verification

For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), "IPLA Program Terms" 
means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents 
provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM 
Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not 
limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and 
migration.

The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during 
the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.

11.1 Verification Process

Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate 
written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient 
to provide auditable verification that Licensee's use of all Programs is in 
compliance with the IPLA Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of 
IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is 
responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) 
remaining in compliance with IPLA Program Terms.

Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with IPLA Program 
Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any 
purpose) Programs subject to IPLA Program Terms. Such verification will be 
conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's business, and may 
be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use 
an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a 
written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.

11.2 Resolution

IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that 
Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise 
not in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay 
directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such 
excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of 
such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other 
liabilities determined as a result of such verification.

12. Third Party Notices

The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, 
licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party 
code ("Third Party Notices") are included for Licensee's information only. 
These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s). Information on how 
to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third 
Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as 
"Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the 
Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that 
directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is 
only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party 
code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the 
unmodified Program.

13. General

a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its 
shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the 
IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and 
IBM.

c. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, 
the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.

d. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations, including U.S. embargo and sanctions regulations and prohibitions 
on export for certain end uses or to certain users.

e. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its 
subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business 
Partners) to store and use Licensee's business contact information wherever 
they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in 
furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.

f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it 
claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The 
parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or 
claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.

g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, 
regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement 
more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration 
of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the 
claim lapse.

h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any 
obligations due to causes beyond its control.

i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this 
Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, 
except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) 
above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible 
personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.

j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any 
representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to 
any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, 
other than as expressly warranted in Section 8 (Warranty and Exclusions) above; 
2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or 
savings that Licensee may achieve.

k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business 
Partners") to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business 
Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for 
the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to 
Licensee.

l. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee's 
other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to 
Program licenses granted under this Agreement.

14. Geographic Scope and Governing Law

14.1 Governing Law

Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which 
Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of

extent permitted by the applicable governing law and rules of procedure:

ASIA PACIFIC

(1) In Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, and Vietnam:

Disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement will be finally 
settled by arbitration which will be held in Singapore in accordance with the 
Arbitration Rules of Singapore International Arbitration Center ("SIAC Rules") 
then in effect. The arbitration award will be final and binding for the parties 
without appeal and will be in writing and set forth the findings of fact and 
the conclusions of law.

The number of arbitrators will be three, with each side to the dispute being 
entitled to appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the 
parties will appoint a third arbitrator who will act as chairman of the 
proceedings. Vacancies in the post of chairman will be filled by the president 
of the SIAC. Other vacancies will be filled by the respective nominating party. 
Proceedings will continue from the stage they were at when the vacancy 
occurred.

If one of the parties refuses or otherwise fails to appoint an arbitrator 
within 30 days of the date the other party appoints its, the first appointed 
arbitrator will be the sole arbitrator, provided that the arbitrator was 
validly and properly appointed. All proceedings will be conducted, including 
all documents presented in such proceedings, in the English language. The 
English language version of this Agreement prevails over any other language 
version.

(2) In the People's Republic of China:

In case no settlement can be reached, the disputes will be submitted to China 
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission for arbitration 
according to the then effective rules of the said Arbitration Commission. The 
arbitration will take place in Beijing and be conducted in Chinese. The

International Program License Agreement

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE 
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF 
ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT 
THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO 
THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM 
YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED 
THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.

"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its 
subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific 
to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ 
. The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of 
a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial 
copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) 
audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) 
related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and 
documentation.

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a 
Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the 
number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for 
warranty, future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional 
opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the 
original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or 
its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies 
the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal 
entity.

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms 
(if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete 
agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any 
prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of 
the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this 
Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the 
terms of the latter agreement prevail.

1. Entitlement

License

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and 
licensed, not sold.

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully 
acquire it.

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) 
make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all 
copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial 
copy, of the Program.

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade 
You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another 
party.

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or 
remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided 
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate 
the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this 
Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its 
PoE.

Money-back Guarantee

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the 
original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if 
within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the 
party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact 
the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.

Program Transfer

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to 
another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When 
You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, 
including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.

2. Charges

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in 
the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, 
except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You 
acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on 
IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified 
or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal 
property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it.

3. Limited Warranty

IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating 
environment it will conform to its specifications. The warranty applies only to 
the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or 
error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct all Program 
defects. You are responsible for the results obtained from the use of the 
Program. 

IBM provides You with access to IBM databases containing information on known 
Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses at no 
additional charge. Consult the IBM Software Support Guide for further 
information at http://www.ibm.com/software/support . IBM will maintain this 
information for at least one year after the original licensee acquires the 
Program ("Warranty Period").

If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and 
the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, 
You may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its 
reseller) from whom You acquired it and receive a refund in the amount You 
paid. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You 
acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund. 

THESE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES 
OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, 
SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES 
APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS 
ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

THESE WARRANTIES GIVE YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER 
RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

4. Limitation of Liability

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, 
regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, 
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract 
or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury 
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the 
Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and 
suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively 
responsible.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES; OR

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

5. General

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force 
and effect.

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations.

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including 
names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such 
information will be processed and used in connection with our business 
relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and 
assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for 
promotions, and for market research).

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local 
law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations 
due to causes beyond its control.

party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You 
except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily 
injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for 
which IBM is legally liable.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration

Program-unique Terms

AUTHORIZED USE:

This Program contains Management Server (Manager) and Agent components (as 
further described in the Program documentation).

You are authorized to use Management Server and Agent components only on IBM 
machines.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Program includes a license for up to 20 
installations of the Agent component on non-IBM x86 systems. These 20 licenses 
for non-IBM x86 systems are not transferable and cannot be combined or 
aggregated. For example, if You buy two IBM machines and install the Program on 
only one of them, You are entitled to install the Agent component on only 20 
non-IBM x86 systems. If You install the Program on both IBM machines, Your 
entitlement is limited to managing 20 non-IBM x86 systems. To install 
additional Agent components on non-IBM x86 systems, You must obtain additional 
Agent component licenses from IBM.
 
For IBM System z machines:
1) when the Agent component is installed on an engine with the Integrated 
Facility for Linux (IFL) feature, You must acquire an authorization for each 
activated engine with the IFL feature on that machine; and
2) when the Agent component is installed on general purpose engines, You must 
acquire an authorization for each activated general purpose engine on that 
machine.

IBM may audit Your compliance with these terms upon reasonable advance notice 
to You.

WARRANTY:

The Specified Operating Environment for the Program may be located in the 
'Hardware and Software Requirements' section of the Program's documentation, 
located in the IBM Information Center.

The Program contains Upward Integration Modules (as described in the 
documentation) for third party system management products to manage IBM 
hardware platforms with IBM Director Agent components. There is no warranty or 
support service available for the Upward Integration Modules when You use a 
third party system management product.

EXPORT LAWS:

The Program contains cryptography for data which is subject to special export 
licensing requirements of the US Department of Commerce or other countries. 
Refer to the Program documentation for details on the available level of 
encryption. You are responsible for complying with all license agreements, 
export requirements and copyright and other applicable laws relating to all 
material You distribute using the Program. You will defend, hold harmless and 
indemnify IBM, including its subsidiaries, and its distributors from and 
against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, expenses, costs, and 
judgments, including attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with any 
breach or alleged breach of Your responsibilities under this agreement and the 
foregoing warranty.

EVALUATION SOFTWARE: 

The Program may contain optional components that can be used for internal 
evaluation, testing, or demonstration purposes for 60 days with a temporary use 
license key. The terms of the "IBM International License Agreement for 
Evaluation of Programs", including this LI, apply during this time. If You want 
to continue to use the Program after 60 days You must then obtain a license. 
The terms of the "IBM International Program License Agreement", including this 
LI, will then apply to Your use of the Program.

The Program may include one or more disabling devices that will prevent certain 
features or options from being used without an authorization. You will not 
tamper with such disabling devices or otherwise change the Program.

SPECIAL TERMS FOR THE SOFTWARE UPDATES COMPONENT:

When You use the Software Updates navigation link of the Program to request 
software updates, the Management Server component collects information about 
the release level of certain software products installed on Your machine 
("Software Information") and electronically sends that Software Information to 
IBM. Software Information does not include business data such as Your 
financial, statistical and personnel data regarding Your business. You agree 
that IBM (including subcontractors and consultants under contract to IBM) may 
store and use Software Information for purposes of software maintenance and 
support, and that such Software Information (including any contact information 
provided by You) may be transferred to such entities in any country whether or 
not a member of the European Union.

Software Updates You receive are covered by this Agreement. If any additional 
or different terms apply to any such Software Update, such terms will be 
included with the Software Update.

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, 
OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND 
WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO 
NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE 
THE PROGRAM; AND

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO

PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.

1. Definitions

"Authorized Use" - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to 
execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, 
millions of service units ("MSUs"), Processor Value Units ("PVUs"), or other 
level of use specified by IBM.

"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") - a document that provides information and any 
additional terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at 
www.ibm.com/software/sla. The LI can also be found in the Program's directory, 
by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.

"Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial 
copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and 
modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or 
pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).

"Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") - evidence of Licensee's Authorized Use. The PoE 
is also evidence of Licensee's eligibility for warranty, future update prices, 
if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not 
provide Licensee with a PoE, then IBM may accept as the PoE the original paid 
sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) 
from whom Licensee obtained the Program, provided that it specifies the Program 
name and Authorized Use obtained.

"Warranty Period" - one year, starting on the date the original Licensee is 
granted the license.

2. Agreement Structure

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms 
(if any), the LI, and the PoE and is the complete agreement between Licensee 
and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written 
communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee's use of the 
Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the 
extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.

3. License Grant

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and 
licensed, not sold.

IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the 
Authorized Use specified in the PoE, 2) make and install copies to support such 
Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy, all provided that

a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of 
this Agreement;

b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot 
execute;

c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on 
each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;

d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally 
or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee's behalf and 2) complies with the 
terms of this Agreement;

e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, 
otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of 
the Program's components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related 
licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or 
lease the Program; and

f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this 
Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in 
the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a 
Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this 
Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this 
Item "f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM 
Program ("Principal Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the 
Principal Program's LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program 
without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom 
Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)

This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.

3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches

3.1.1 Trade-ups

If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program's 
license is promptly terminated.

3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches

When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts 
any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or 
patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are 
provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. 
If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly 
discontinue use of the replaced Program.

3.2 Fixed Term Licenses

If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee's license is terminated 
at the end of the fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.

3.3 Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms 
of this Agreement.

If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to 
promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the 
Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond 
termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to 
both parties' respective successors and assignees.

4. Charges

Charges are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the PoE. 
IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as 
specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or 
an authorized IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.

5. Taxes

If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding 
those based on IBM's net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as 
specified in an invoice, or supply exemption documentation. Licensee is 
responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that 
Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee 
for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program 
outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, 
then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount 
imposed.

6. Money-back Guarantee

If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original 
Licensee, Licensee may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount 
Licensee paid for the Program, provided that Licensee returns the Program and 
PoE to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days of the date the 
PoE was issued to Licensee. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject 
to renewal, then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program and its PoE 
are returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee 
downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee 
obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

7. Program Transfer

Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee's license rights and 
obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this 
Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, 
Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party. Licensee 
may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program's Authorized 
Use. When Licensee transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard 
copy of this Agreement, including the LI and PoE. Immediately after the 
transfer, Licensee's license terminates.

8. Warranty and Exclusions

8.1 Limited Warranty

IBM warrants that the Program, when used in its specified operating 
environment, will conform to its specifications. The Program's specifications, 
and specified operating environment information, can be found in documentation 
accompanying the Program (such as a read-me file) or other information 
published by IBM (such as an announcement letter). Licensee agrees that such 
documentation and other Program content may be supplied only in the English 
language, unless otherwise required by local law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation.

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does 
not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program, or that IBM 
will correct all Program defects. Licensee is responsible for the results 
obtained from the use of the Program.

During the Warranty Period, IBM provides Licensee with access to IBM databases 
containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, 
restrictions, and bypasses at no additional charge. Consult the IBM Software 
Support Handbook for further information at www.ibm.com/software/support.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and 
the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, 
Licensee may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its 
reseller) from whom Licensee obtained it and receive a refund of the amount 
Licensee paid. After returning the Program, Licensee's license terminates. If 
Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom 
Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

8.2 Exclusions

THESE WARRANTIES ARE LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF 
NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE 
WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, 
SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

THESE WARRANTIES GIVE LICENSEE SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE 
OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 8 (WARRANTY AND EXCLUSIONS) ARE PROVIDED SOLELY 
BY IBM. THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SUBSECTION 8.2 (EXCLUSIONS), HOWEVER, ALSO 
APPLY TO IBM'S SUPPLIERS OF THIRD PARTY CODE. THOSE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE SUCH CODE 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT NULLIFY 
IBM'S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9. Licensee Data and Databases

To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM 
may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 
2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not 
obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate 
written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of 
technical support, which is beyond IBM's warranty obligations in this 
Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to 
improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related 
support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and 
subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which 
Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.

Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database 
Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of 
procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and 
transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) 
backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send 
or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in 
data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other 
amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided 
to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those 
arising out of any third party claims.

10. Limitation of Liability

The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) 
apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the 
possibility of contractual waiver.

10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other 
liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the 
basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including 
fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort 
claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or 
related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not 
exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and 
damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual 
direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term 
charges, up to twelve months' charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is 
the subject of the claim.

This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is 
the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are 
collectively responsible.

10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR 
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:

a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR

c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

11. Compliance Verification

For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), "IPLA Program Terms" 
means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents 
provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM 
Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not 
limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and 
migration.

The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during 
the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.

11.1 Verification Process

Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate 
written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient 
to provide auditable verification that Licensee's use of all Programs is in 
compliance with the IPLA Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of 
IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is 
responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) 
remaining in compliance with IPLA Program Terms.

Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with IPLA Program 
Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any 
purpose) Programs subject to IPLA Program Terms. Such verification will be 
conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's business, and may 
be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use 
an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a 
written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.

11.2 Resolution

IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that 
Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise 
not in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay 
directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such 
excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of 
such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other 
liabilities determined as a result of such verification.

12. Third Party Notices

The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, 
licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party 
code ("Third Party Notices") are included for Licensee's information only. 
These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s). Information on how 
to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third 
Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as 
"Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the 
Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that 
directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is 
only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party 
code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the 
unmodified Program.

13. General

a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that 
cannot be waived or limited by contract.

b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its 
shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the 
IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and 
IBM.

c. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, 
the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.

d. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations, including U.S. embargo and sanctions regulations and prohibitions 
on export for certain end uses or to certain users.

e. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its 
subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business 
Partners) to store and use Licensee's business contact information wherever 
they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in 
furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.

f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it 
claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The 
parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or 
claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.

g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, 
regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement 
more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration 
of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the 
claim lapse.

h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any 
obligations due to causes beyond its control.

i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this 
Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, 
except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) 
above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible 
personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.

j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any 
representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to 
any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, 
other than as expressly warranted in Section 8 (Warranty and Exclusions) above; 
2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or 
savings that Licensee may achieve.

k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business 
Partners") to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business 
Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for 
the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to 
Licensee.

l. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee's 
other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to 
Program licenses granted under this Agreement.

14. Geographic Scope and Governing Law

14.1 Governing Law

Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which 
Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of 
Licensee's and IBM's respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from,

third party license agreement(s) governs Licensee's use of all Separately 
Licensed Code unless otherwise noted below.

Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed 
Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed 
in another NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. 
Licensee acknowledges that Licensee has read and agrees to the license 
agreements contained in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s). If Licensee does not agree 
to the terms of these third party license agreements, Licensee may not use the 
Separately Licensed Code.

For Programs acquired under the International Program License Agreement 
("IPLA") or International Program License Agreement for Non Warranted Program 
("ILAN") and Licensee is the original licensee of the Program, if Licensee does 
not agree with the third party license agreements, Licensee may return the 
Program in accordance with the terms of, and within the specified time frames 
stated in, the "Money-back Guarantee" section of the IPLA or ILAN IBM 
Agreement.

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, 
the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM:
(a) IBM provides this Separately Licensed Code to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
OF ANY KIND;
(b) IBM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR 
INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE;
(c) IBM is not liable to Licensee, and will not defend, indemnify, or hold 
Licensee harmless for any claims arising from or related to the Separately 
Licensed Code; and
(d) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, 
punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, 
lost savings, and lost profits, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code.

Notwithstanding these exclusions, in Germany and Austria, IBM's warranty and 
liability for the Separately Licensed Code is governed only by the respective 
terms applicable for Germany and Austria in IBM license agreements.

Note: IBM may provide limited support for some Separately Licensed Code. If

Program-unique Terms

AUTHORIZED USE:

This Program contains Management Server (Manager) components, Agent components, 
and application programming interfaces (APIs), as further described in the 
Program documentation.

Licensee is authorized to use Management Server and Agent components only on 
IBM machines.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Program includes a license for up to 20 
installations of the Agent component on non-IBM x86 systems. These 20 licenses 
for non-IBM x86 systems are not transferable and cannot be combined or 
aggregated. For example, if Licensee buys two IBM machines and install the 
Program on only one of them, Licensee is entitled to install the Agent 
component on only 20 non-IBM x86 systems. If Licensee installs the Program on 
both IBM machines, Licensee's entitlement is limited to managing 20 non-IBM x86 
systems. To install additional Agent components on non-IBM x86 systems, 
Licensee must obtain additional Agent component licenses from IBM.

The Program includes APIs called Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs. 
The Program's REST APIs are described in the Program's documentation, available 
through the IBM Systems Director Information Center. Licensee may develop 
applications using the Program's REST APIs solely for testing and deployment 
within Licensee's Enterprise and only in connection with Licensee's internal 
business purposes. An Enterprise is any legal entity (such as a corporation) 
and the subsidiaries it owns by more than 50 percent. Licensee may not rent, 
lease, loan, sell or otherwise distribute applications or derivative works 
created using the Program's REST APIs to third party end users external to 
Licensee's Enterprise unless Licensee has entered into a written contract with 
IBM for this purpose.

For IBM System z machines, the authorization required for the Program is based 
on the following:

1) When the Program is installed on or managing engines with the Integrated 
Facility for Linux (IFL) feature, Licensee must acquire an authorization for 
each activated engine with the IFL feature on that machine.

2) When the Program is installed on or managing general purpose engines, 
Licensee must acquire an authorization for each activated general purpose 
engine on that machine.

WARRANTY:

The Specified Operating Environment for the Program may be located in the 
'Hardware and Software Requirements' section of the Program's documentation, 
located in the IBM Information Center.

The Program contains Upward Integration Modules (as described in the 
documentation) for third party system management products to manage IBM 
hardware platforms with IBM Director Agent components. There is no warranty or 
support service available for the Upward Integration Modules when Licensee uses 
a third party system management product.

EXPORT LAWS:

This Program contains cryptography for data. Licensee is hereby notified that 
transfer to, or use by, users of the Program may be prohibited or subject to 
export or import laws, regulations or policies, including those of the United 
States Export Administration Regulations. Licensee assumes all responsibility 
for complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding the 
export, import, or use of this Program, including but not limited to, U.S. 
restrictions on exports or reexports. Refer to ibm.com to obtain the export 
classification of this Program at: 
https://www-112.ibm.com/products/exporting/swclass 

EVALUATION SOFTWARE:

The Program may contain optional components that can be used for internal 
evaluation, testing, or demonstration purposes for 60 days with a temporary use 
license key. The terms of the "IBM International License Agreement for 
Evaluation of Programs", including this LI, apply during this time. If Licensee 
wants to continue to use the Program after 60 days Licensee must then obtain a 
license. The terms of the "IBM International Program License Agreement", 
including this LI, will then apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

The Program may include one or more disabling devices that will prevent certain 
features or options from being used without an authorization. Licensee shall 
not tamper with such disabling devices or otherwise change the Program.

SPECIAL TERMS FOR THE SOFTWARE UPDATES COMPONENT:

When Licensee uses the Software Updates navigation link of the Program to 
request software updates, the Management Server component collects information 
about the release level of certain software products installed on Licensee's 
machine ("Software Information") and electronically sends that Software 
Information to IBM. Software Information does not include business data such as 
Licensee's financial, statistical and personnel data regarding Licensee's 
business. Licensee agrees that IBM (including subcontractors and consultants 
under contract to IBM) may store and use Software Information for purposes of 
software maintenance and support, and that such Software Information (including 
any contact information provided by Licensee) may be transferred to such 
entities in any country whether or not a member of the European Union.

Software Updates Licensee receives are covered by this Agreement. If any 
additional or different terms apply to any such Software Update, such terms 
will be included with the Software Update.

                           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

                               Version 2, June 1991

        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass
        Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and
        distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
        it is not allowed.

                                     Preamble

        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
        License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
        free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
        This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
        to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
        covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can
        apply it to your programs, too.

        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
        charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
        or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
        use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
        these things.

        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
        for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
        it.

        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
        that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
        get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.

        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
        and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
        copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
        certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
        this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and
        passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
        not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will
        not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
        patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
        program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
        the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
        that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
        licensed at all.

        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.

                            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

        0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
        a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
        distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
        "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work
        based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
        work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
        Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
        and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
        is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
        licensee is addressed as "you".

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
        running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
        Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
        the Program (independent of having been made by running the
        Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
        warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
        this License along with the Program.

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
        and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
        for a fee.

        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
        not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
        works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
        to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
        when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
        work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
        the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
        extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
        regardless of who wrote it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Program.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
        volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
        work under the scope of this License.

        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
        of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
        following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such an
        offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
        making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
        code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
        any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
        control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as
        a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
        form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
        the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
        component itself accompanies the executable.

        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
        except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
        void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
        License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
        you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
        long as such parties remain in full compliance.

        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
        and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
        modifying the Program or works based on it.

        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
        herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
        parties to this License.

        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
        issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
        agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
        your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
        Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
        royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
        copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
        could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
        from distribution of the Program.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
        in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
        any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
        the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
        willing to distribute software through any other system and a
        licensee cannot impose that choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
        to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
        the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
        in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
        License.

        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
        it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
        terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
        specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
        version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
        the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
        Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
        will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
        all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
        and reuse of software generally.

                                    NO WARRANTY

        11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
        AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
        FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
        DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
        OR CORRECTION.

        12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
        MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
        OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
        OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
